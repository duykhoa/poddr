1. What is situation with the application?
  - Once, written, this application need never change
  - Design doesn't matter, once written, it runs forever
  - Like a circus performer spinning plates in a world without friction & gravity
  - It always does change

- What is the reason make the application change all the time
  - Customer doesn't know what they want
  - You know how to do something better than what customer need
  - Customer doesn't say what they meant
  - You didn't understand what their needs
  - Application isn't stable (depend on 3rd party plugins, services)
  - All of them

- The main purpose of OOP design
  - Deliver code asap
  - Just an art to arrange code
  - Write code for future needs
  - Create code to be amenable to being changed later

- Taking part of future consideration will take you more time to produce the product, and it isn't possible because you can't guess for the future need.
Is it true (Y/N)

- Design should anticipate with
  - Specific future requirements
  - Imagination about the future of the product
  - Experience from previous project, then add more features for future need
  - Leave room to add or refactor, reduce cost of change

- What is the tool of OOP Design
  - OOP Principle & UML
  - Sequence Diagram & Design Pattern
  - OOP Principle & Design pattern
  - Gang of Four & Law of Demeter

- What can make an application fails
  - Dont understand completely about the language
  - Hire no experience developer
  - Lack of OOP design
  - All of them

- Yes, I can add this feature, but it will break everything is a symtom of
  - Developer lack of experience
  - Developer is too junior
  - Bad application design
  - The Application is developed in an unmodern language

- Which one is true
  - Developer can be success in Ruby but can make an impossible to change application
  - Programmer are aware with OOP design techniques but do not yet understand how to apply
  - Overdesign can make application hard to change
  - All of them

- What make you a better OOP designer
  - Read the book many times
  - Read about design pattern, SOLID
  - Practice What you have learned
  - Learn many languages as possible
