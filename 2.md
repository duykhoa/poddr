1. What is the foundation (the core) of OOP
  - Class
  - Object
  - Message
  - Instance variable
- What is the most **visible** organization structure in OOP
  - Class
  - Object
  - Message
  - Instance variable
- To answer these question: What's your classes, how many should you have, what behavior will they implement, how much they know about other class, you can
  - Know the name of classes in your application
  - Know what's supposed to do right now, and it'll never change in the future
  - Know what's supposed to do right now and easy to change in the future
  - Write the perfect application with inheritance hierachy of classes
- A class is
  - A group of methods
  - A virtual world
  - A box of contrains
  - A Model of Rails application
- What define an easy to change code
  - Changes have no unexpected side effects
  - Small changes in requirements require correspondingly small change in code
  - Existing code is easy to reuse
  - The easiest way to make a change is to add code that in itself is easy to change
  - All of them
- What is wrong about TRUE code
  - Usable: Existing code should be usable in new and unexpected context
  - Transparent: Obvious and in distant code that relies on it
  - Exemplary: The code itself should encourage people who change it to refactor code
  - Reasonable: Cost of change should be similiar with benefit the change achieves
- Why SRP matter
  - Class has more than 1 responsibility is hard to change
  - Class has more than 1 responsibility is hard to use
  - Class has more than 1 responsibility can make you likely duplicated some part to other module
  - Class has more than 1 responsibility may change for an unreleated reason and break the application
  - All of them
- The best way to describe a class' responsibility is in
  - 1 sentence
  - 2 sentences
  - 3 sentences
  - 4 sentences
- How to determine a SRP class by the description
  - 1 sentence, can use AND and OR
  - 2 sentence, can use AND but not OR
  - 1 sentence, not use AND or OR
  - 1 sentence, can use OR
- Base on RDD, SRP mean
  - A class only do one narrow thing
  - A class has responsibilities that fulfill its purpose
  - A change is make for a single nitpicky reason
  - A class should be simple
- Which question is not belong to Gear responsibility
  - What is your ratio
  - What is your class Name
  - What is your gear_inch
  - What is your tire's size
- To make a good design of your class, you should
  - Feel compelled to make decision prematurely
  - Wait for more information and start design
  - Start write code now
  - Make sure the code is TRUE code
- Give the Gear class

  ```ruby
    class Gear
      attr_reader :chainring, :cog, :rim, :tire

      def initialize(chainring, cog, rim, tire)
        @chainring = chainring
        @cog = cog
        @rim = rim
        @tire = tire
      end

      def ratio
        chainring / cog.to_f
      end

      def gear_inches
        # tire goes around rim twice for diameter
        ratio * (rim + (tire * 2))
      end
    end
  ```

  This class is
  - Not usable
  - Not transparent
  - Not resonable
  - Exemplary
- The cost of some bad design today is
  - You or other developer will fix it sometime
  - Developer will follow this pattern and make more bad design
  - It does more than one responsibility, so changing it may make something break
  - Other developer doesn't have enough knowledge about your class, and he may duplicate the existing code for another feature
- Which statement is incorrect
  - This "improve it now" and "improve it later" tension always exist.
  - Applications are never perfectly designed
  - Every choice has a price
  - Other developer will help you fix your bad design today.
- SRP is applied to
  - Class only
  - Module only
  - Rails models and concern
  - Everything in OOP application
- Extract method to make
  - Method smaller
  - Reveal better design
  - Isolate the behavior of a complicated method
  - All of them
- What is the advantage of simple method
  - No comment need
  - Encourage reuse
  - Easy to move
  - Expose hidden qualities
  - All of them
- What should be hide in a class
  - Data structure
  - Data
  - Private method
  - All of them
