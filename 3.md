1. What is a sign of a dependency
  - The name of another class
  - Name of the message that it intends to send to someone other than self
  - The arguments that a message requires
  - The order of these arguments
  - All of them

- What is true about dependency
  - A class shouldn't have any dependency
  - Dependency is unneccessary
  - The unneccessary dependencies make the code less reasonable
  - The challenge of design is to manage dependencies, restrict to one for each class

- Which one is true for tightly couple
  - When you try to use one of them in another context, just copy the part you need to another class
  - These objects act like single thing, they change together
  - It's impossible to reuse just one
  - It's easier to rewrite everything than change anything

- Test may be considered as a dependency, is it true?
  - Yes
  - No

- What should you do if you can't remove unnecessary dependencies
  - Isolate them to methods
  - Ignore the code as it is
  - Document the dependencies in your code
  - Write another class to reimplement dependency

- Given the code

```
  @is_checked = args[:check] || true
```

This code:
  - Can be shorten to @is_checked ||= true
  - Perfectly simple
  - Contains a bug
  - Use to set value for a class variable

- How can we remove the default value
```
  @var = args[:avar] || 40
```

  - Merge args with default values
  - Deep merge args with default values
  - Replace the code by a method, which determine if args is present
  - Set directly @var after create
