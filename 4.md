1. Talk about the kitchen, why does customer never order directly to the chef
  - They need to come to the kitchen, that is not good
  - Make jobs for waiter
  - Then customer must understand about the chefs, also the ingredient, that is not their responsibility
  - It's hot in the kitchen
- Public interface will reveal the responsibility of the class
  - True
  - False
- What is true about the public interface
  - Reveal its primary responsibility
  - Are expected to be invoked by otherd
  - Stable
  - All of them
- What is true about private interface
  - Handle implement details
  - Are not expected to be sent by other object
  - Not well document
  - Unsafe and can change anytime
  - All of them
- Because SRP say that a class have only one single purposee, so it should have only 1 public interface
  - True
  - False
- Writing code after knowing the requirement is not a good idea, neither writing test, so what is your first step?
  - This argument is wrong. Wring test is easy, it drives the development progress
  - Put you pen to paper, determine the pattern for your application
  - Ask the expert how to organize the code
  - Don't do anything
- After figure how domain objects, which tool can be use to organize the flow of your application
  - Use-case diagram
  - Rspec
  - Sequence diagram
  - erd
- What is 2 main parts of the sequence diagram
  - Object & Class
  - Object & Message
  - Data & Methods
  - Public interface & Message
- The fundamental design question is
  - I need to send this message, who should respond it
  - I have this class, what should it do
  - Ask for what, instead of telling how
  - Depend on the stage of the design progress, you pick the correct answerr
- Given the code

  ```
  class Trip
    def prepare_trip
      bikes = mechanic.prepare_strip(self)
  
      bikes.each do |bike|
        mechanice.prepare(bike)
      end
    end
  end
  ```

which one describes correctly the design above

  - I know what I want and I trust you to do your part
  - I know what I want and I know how you do it
  - I know what I want and I know what you
  - I don't know what's going on

- Which technique can be used when you consider an object know too much
  - Introduce new class
  - Extract to new method
  - Move methods around object
  - Rename the method and class to a more general name
- Put the method under the private scope to
  - Tell people about the unstablability of this method
  - Prevent people to use it
  - To prevent writing test for them
  - Tell people that you will change tis method without notify them
- What can you do if you can't prevent using a prive method
  - Isolate them in 1 place of your application
  - Document it carefully
  - Rewrite it
  - Paste the code in your application
- What should I do if the current class that I depend on doesn't have the public inteface
  - Continue use it
  - Rewrite a better class
  - Create a wrapper class with a public interface
  - Create a methods in your class, may be a private methods
  - C & D
